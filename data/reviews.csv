lung lung,2,"Ice cap still consistently good.  Just the staff wouldn't give me some cream and milk to add into it to make it less sweet.  They wouldn't even give me water... lol I'm thinking, even if I order a regular coffee, they would ask me how many cream or sugar.  I'm not sure if this is company policy or just staff incompetency.  Also tables are dirty.  Lucky I had wetnaps with me"
Saad Asif,1,"This is Hands down the WORSTTTT FREAKINNGGG Tim hortons I have ever been to. People working here need some real customer service training. They almost never have anything, I swear I wemt there once to order my double double coffee, They did not have a freakinggg Cream y'all, CANN YOU BELIEVE THIS!!!"
trapzzz,1,"This place never has any food in the afternoon/evening and they are understaffed as well. The Indian lady who works there in the evening has a very bad attitude. She doesn't want people to order food and looks visibly upset if someone does order food, and she just looks like she hates her job in general."
Queen Leo,5,I love this place but it's a little bit dark and there should be seasonal colors on the windows like for Christmas for winter anything to make more attract people from miles it looks always close from far ...
BOUCH,1,"Worst Tim's I've ever been to and will never go back. It wasn't busy, one person ahead of me. Took over 10 minutes to get two coffees. They all appeared to have no idea what they were doing. I love Tims, never again at this location."
Norberto Palao,5,"I had the misfortune of dropping my wallet while having coffee.  I only noticed I was missing it 2 hours later after coming home.  I came back to the restaurant to find out that the store manager, Newran Vijayaraja, had found it.  Newran, after some time of having put it away in a safe place, brought it to the Pointe Claire police station.  Newran then offered to drive me to the station to recover it.  Newran Vijayaraja is an honest class act human being.  I will be forever grateful and in debt with him for his action.  Tim Hortons on Hymus is lucky to have such an individual as their store manager!"
Jabbatorre Da The Hut,4,"Some comments on g-map are pretty bad so I was apprehensive, but the shelves were actually filled with fresh donuts (you can tell by the look of the glaze) and the coffee was hot. I was served in French, but the staff was bilingual. Some of the equipment could use a bit of dusting - but nothing unusual for this type of fast food."
le Revenant,1,"This store is overwhelmed and under staffed. It’s unfortunate as the location is a killer spot and it’s always busy. Hut busier than they can handle. Whether your do mobile order, in store, or uber, the wait is going to be long.

Experienced staff members are scattered trying to keep up and items are getting lost.

There is a paper sign in the window indicating that they’re hiring, either the pay is too low for the amount of pressure the staff get put through. I waited 25 mins for a bagel.

And some had been waiting on their mobile orders the entire time i was there.

This place needs staffing bad.

If your heading this way be sure to practice patience."
Roger Brassard,1,"What do you need to do to loose your franchise.

I am at home sick, I ordered through Uber toast and jam. This is what I received. Really hardly any jam, how hard is it to slice the bread and put more than a microscopic amount. I called the store to complain and they where not interested and where annoyed. Very poor service and customer care. 18 dollars for muffin “they did not mess up the muffin” tea and toast, I wish I could get a refund, lousy, lousy store"
Marc The Frenchie Canadian,1,"Poorly lit, ice Capp tasted off, and to top it all off, the ""employee"" who served me didn't even look like an employee....no Tim shirt, no hat, no smile, not even a mandatory hair net over his full head of hair....not sure I have a reason to recommend this place"
Alyssa D,3,"coffee taste like nothing, food is dry and bland. too expensive. its not the staff’s fault, corporate decided a few years ago to stop making fresh food. the team on the spot really tries their hardest to offer a good service ut their limited by tim hortons business choice."
labyrinthfan2,1,Honestly I would give a negative if I could there is new staff I asked for a switch and refused to do it.  And this place always used to be busy at lunch. It also doesn’t help when you hire students or people that don’t wanna do their jobs or go out of their way. I have gone there before and there was never an issue after this I’ve been turned off this location forever
Steve Maigue,5,"Quick workers, stocked well in the morning. Didn’t have to wait too long :)"
Leonid Chukhovsky,5,"Fast service, fresh food, everything as good as it gets."

------------------
Tried this location once more and sadly no improvement, bare shelves, no timbits, next to no donuts (picture is pretty clear).  We left and went to the Tim Hortons at the corner of Hymus and Blvd Des Sources where all their shelves were full!  I'm surprised Tim Hortons doesn't address the franchisee as this is a continuous failure to provide service and gives their brand a black eye.

2019-06-20
------------------
Went back tonight to get a treat from my daughters and sadly, same thing as last time.  Their display was bare!  I overheard the supervisor tell an employee ""bake things just to throw them out, no"".  So she prefers to have nothing and turn clients away.  Anyways, this was my final visit at this location.  It's the closest to me, but selection/service is garbage at this point.  Too bad as it wasn't always like this.  It used to be great.

2019-03-24 (2 stars)
------------------
Steady decline in quality.  Getting worse and worse, shelves completely bare this time (picture says it all)!  Coffee shop with no donuts or Timbits!  No words.

Drove to blvd. Des Sources and Hymus and they are fully stocked there.  Go there instead.

2018-01-14 (down to 3 stars)
------------------
Went yesterday, their shelves were bare, absolutely no selection whatsoever and got a box of Timbit.  When we got home they were stale.  Very disappointing experience.

Original Review (was 4 stars)
-------------------------
Usually good coffee, fresh products and quick service.  Bathrooms are also kept very clean.

No drive through though.

I've gone there numerous time and have only had one error with my order which was quickly corrected without any hassel.  Everyone makes mistakes, it""s the way it is handled that is important and they seem to handle it here very well. By"
Jj premium car detailing,1,"They have no more breakfast and its still the morning, the service is slow and lazy.DO NOT COME HERE!!"
Alexandra,4,"I’ve been here a few times. Service is fast, employees are nice, and the food is good. No mistakes on my orders. Only things that could improve is the cleanliness of the washrooms."
Ali Rezaee,2,"Today, officially I have more than 10 online order wrong! Sometimes donuts or hash brown are missing for office and sometimes my drink is wrong.

I get it, mistakes happen but this looks like they are under staffed and pressured.

Pleasant people working there though."
Joe Cruise,4,"Its your usual Tim Hortons.  This particular outlet is located in a mini mall so at least you have other shopping options.  For instance Wal-Mart, Home Depot, Dollarama, Sail and l'Equipeur.  As for dining there is a Chez Cora and A&W.  Plenty of parking.

As a side not I'm not sure if the clientele has changed or people are plain lazy these days.  Empty containers left on tables and trash left on the floor.  The staff did do a good job of cleaning when they had the chance though."
Daninc 2k,3,"Average Tim Hortons. Okay food, okay service, they usually have everything on the menu."
Oleg Didic,1,"The worst place in the galaxy. They neer wants to work. You can't eat here afternoon. At 1 p.m. they start to prepare for closing at 8 p.m., and no food is served.
... and it's dirty"
leto BG,2,Poor service. The girl at the cashier (red hair'ish) is rude and shouldn't be client facing!
Anne Blanchette,1,"Horrible service, I'm on the road every day, I'm always go to tim horton's or McDonald's, very poor service, does this sandwich look lightly toasted, no it doesn't its burnt in the inside and white on the outside no butter,which was asked for, asked for 3 muffins got two,and the argue with u, about the order, every single time they screw up my order, and u ask to speak with the manager, then yr told u have to come back during the week, I m looking for another place to go"
ilove montreal,5,Love that place best tim Horton ever I love all the employee they are full of happiness I enjoy each second of sitting in that location super clean extra fast service well organized employee well trained they know exactly how and what to do love it
D W,1,"Sunday morning, September 24, 8:05 a.m.  Ordered two breakfast sandwiches with bacon only to be told we have no bacon. Asked for two black coffee, one with a shot of espresso. Guess what….we don’t have any espresso. Took what they had as we were in a hurry but never again. Not even sure if I got a price break on the two breakfast sandwiches with egg and cheese only, no bacon. Certainly won’t be going back."
Karolane Vattelli,1,"If I could give 0 stars, I would.

This is the worst Tim Horton’s in the whole West Island.

I’ve been there seversl times since it’s close to my work place. After today, I decided I had enough and it was time for a review.

I had to wait 40 minutes to order. I arrived at 1PM and the line was so long and the service so slow that it took 40 minutes just to get to the counter to order.

Several people quit after a few minutes realizing how ridiculous the wait was.

This location is severly ubderstaffed and the poeple who actually work there are terribly under qualified, probably due to the lack of training.

The person who took my order didn’t know how to use their computer system and was visibly really aggravated about it.

After paying and waiting for my order, they came back saying to me that they didn’t have brown bred anymore as I ordered. I mentioned that white bread would be fine. They came back a few minutes later to tell me that they were also out of white bread.

They wanted me to replace my order by something else which I politely declined and they were visibly mad at me for not wanting something else. They told me that if I wanted a refund that I needed to get back in line.

Since I was on my lunch break I didn’t have time to wait another 40 minutes seeing as my lunch break was 15 minutes from it’s end.

I then wasn’t allowed a refund."
David Bodi,3,Many Tim Horton locations are dirty. Never was like that before.
najla Mohmand,4,"I totally dislike atmosphere, it's very dark not attractive and sleepy place lights are not bright, I love Tim Hortons but this place is something not attractive."
Isabella,1,"The most rude staff . Wrong order and then told me it was our fault.
Our first Tim Horton’s experience and we won’t be back"
Keely McGlynn,1,"We order DELIVERY from them and they put our hot and cold drinks in a Tim Hortons Tim bit box 📦 which when we picked it up exploded on our living room floor spraying our furniture, coffee in my hair and eyes .. I call the manager and his solution is for ME to come pick up “replacement drinks” no empathy, no sorry… he should be fired."
William Bougie,3,Same old same old. At least at this location ... they are nice and fast
David James,4,Cashiers are great.  I enjoy speaking with Kelly.
Christine Moryas,3,The location is badly understaffed and the wait is extremely long but the staff that is there are very nice and efficient. Just needs better management of staff as there was a table cleaner standing around alot of the time while the staff behind the counter were running around trying to get orders completed.
Helena Daly,4,Enjoyed warming up with a large coffee and wild blueberry muffin
najla Mohmand,4,"I totally dislike atmosphere, it's very dark not attractive and sleepy place lights are not bright, I love Tim Hortons but this place is something not attractive."
Valentina Hayduk,5,"I was so impressed with the efficient and quick service I received.
Such a pleasant and courteous staff. The young man who served me,
Philip, was very patient and informative about my choices, just to make sure I wouldn't be disappointed with my order.
Thanks to him, I really enjoyed my meal !
Bravo to the management for training such responsible young employees.
Highly recommended!"
Sergio Nuñez,5,Prompt. Hot beverages. Nice people
TCongo,5,"Your average tim horton plus. This place just looks fancier. The location is great, I would say that you will have a parking spot any time you go there. Good service and good food."
Jack Sparrow,4,Timmy Time at Tim Hortons :) Nothing like a hot chocolate n a Maple Glazed doughnut on a really cold day bbbrrr...
Carl Dourambeis,1,"Activated app for 2 deals, any size coffee and breakfast sandwich for 4 bucks, and 10 tidbits for 1 dollar. I was charged full price. Bait and switch. When I went to pick up the order, it was Kaos. My order was not ready. They did not even know what it was. They had no ticket. Tim Hortons app is garbage. This location is too busy to serve properly. Never again.  I want my refund on what the app promised. Rip off!!!"
Terri Hamelin,2,"My advice to people who buy from this Tim Hortons is to ask for your receipt once you have paid. This location is siphoning off it's customers. Yesterday, I bought 6 muffins and a $10 gift card. I paid with cash $20. I got back 40 cents change instead on $2.40. I asked for the receipt because of the gift card. I looked at the receipt and the employee punched in that I paid $18. This isn't the first time it has happened to me at this location. But it is the last. Never going back. Check your receipts people!"
james pfeiffer,1,Absolutely horrible service the staff is very very unorganized took 25 minutes for one sandwich. Need to close the store at this point. Also I went in after a mobile order at 7 pm and they were closed the staff were still inside and would not open the door for me to explain after I wasted 20 dollars on food I never got.
Kathy Knight,1,"The service was very poor from the moment I had to wait 30mins to get a bagel with cream cheese and a muffin. When I reached my destination, the bagel wasn't cut properly and t wasn't toasted with cream cheese only on a part of the bagel. Spoiled my entire morning with not only long waiting time but then not able to enjoy the bagel."
Kim Rozon,1,What a dirty dirt place. The floors were horribly dirty the windows in the display were smudged of grease and dirt. I went in for an Ice Cap… good thing because the food counter was totally unsanitary. Don’t go ever!!!
Maxximus,2,This location constantly runs out of breakfast items by mid morning. Bad inventory management. Staff nice enough though.
Kevin Smale,2,"Staff is friendly, but night is very disappointing.

I saw it was 24 hours, so I went in just before 1AM and they had basically nothing. Cookies? None. Muffins? One type. Donuts? Poor selection. I asked for a grilled cheese and was told they could not make me one, I could only choose combos 1, 2, or 3. I ordered a bagel and a french vanilla. I was then informed that the machine for french vanilla (and hot chocolate) was broken.

Would never go back at night again, only in the daytime."
Gali Zaki,3,"I've had a couple of rocky visits, one of the employees working (Seems to be a manager or owner), is very rude & impatient. Other than him, the rest of the staff is very sweet & friendly, I always get a smiley on my cup!"
Guy Belliveau,5,"Today I ordered 4 Egg, cheese, bacon sandwiches on a biscuit. 4 hash browns as well. I received my 4 sandwiches on English muffins and no bacon. The hash browns were so oily that they soaked the paper they were wrapped in and glued themselves to the wrapper. Very messy and falling apart.  Unfortunately it was a takeout order so I only noticed the order errors when I got home. I'd like to think that  this happens rarely but this location has repeatedly made errors like these. Sad. I will not return to this location unless it's just for a coffee. It's hard to get that wrong."
Liam Lalonde,3,"Acceptably quick and efficient employees, as long as you yourself (the client) approach the cashier with your order already in mind. Plenty of seating, table for two to four people each. Understandably, there is a limited amount of window space due to the shape of the building. Can become crowded in the midday."
Trevor Martin,1,Tried going here at 7:45pm thursday the 21st (they close at 8pm) just to quickly get a donut and the doors are locked but theres a guy and a girl hooking up where they make the food you can see from the sidewalk.. Its hilarious but absolutely disgusting.....needless to say i never got my donut 👁️👄👁️ …
Field Racer,3,"Very polite staff, but very slow. Ordered a hot chocolate and ice cap. Took 15 minutes to get my order. And there was only one other person in front of me. Was quite bizarre I've never had such slow service for a fully staffed location."
Christine Tousignant,1,"If I could give no stars I would - big line ups because the staff is on one speed - reverse!!!!  The woman who served me was more concerned about counting and converting her tip money than serving me.  The place is dirty and the washrooms are FILTHY!!!!!  Shame on the franchaisee - this place is not up to Tim Horton's standards!!!  I've been here once before for the ""all day breakfast"" - it was 11:00 am and they had run out of sausage - what happened to ALL DAY BREAKFAST???  I won't be going back there and my next complaint is going straight to Corporate.  No excuse for all of this!!"
Dan TheMan,1,Closed before 8pm not happy and not coming back
Ricardo Sibaja,3,"Tim Hortons is nice honestly even when it's not the best high quality coffee and donuts I think it's tasty for the price you're paying, in general I love it. Coffee, chocochip muffin, BLT sandwich or the travalleur sandwich are the best. This particular Tim's in the morning until lunch time is great, fast and you can stay there enjoying, don't go after lunch, I don't know why but the second shift is rude and impolite, the food is old (I think is the remaining food from the morning that nobody wanted it) and the place is dirty. Go in the morning sucks in the afternoon"
Ian Galt,1,"Horrible spot. Filthy counters, dirty windows, under-staffed, burnt food. One and done. Never going again. Plus they were out of half the stuff on their menu"
Adam McIntyre,1,"Manager needs to dip into his pockets and hire more staff.
Every time I come in here, there is not enough staff, so the service is always slow. It is also disgusting in here, with dirty tables, floors and overflowing garbage bins."
Steven Thompson,3,One of the slower tim hortons in the area and the workers aren't always the best but they do have one of the best employees around and his name is Felix. The guy is amazing at his job and whenever he takes my order I know it's going to be made correct and fast. Keep up the good work Felix.
Katie Maguire,1,"I went to get toast. They were out of white bread. I paid for 2 slices of cheese I got only 1. The toast was burnt. It was also cold. When I called to complain I was told the manager was not in and they were not sure when s/he would be in. I could not speak to the supervisor either., bad service bad food."
Janani Jegan,1,Staff are unorganized and completely lost. Not efficient at all during rush hour time. Having customers wait for extended amount of time without taking orders trying to figure out who's order is what. Please train them or hire more employees
Cassandra,1,Slowest “fast food” service i have ever received for 1 coffee. Was late to work
Chris,1,Not open 24 hours like their store and website says they should be.
chase lipari,1,"Pretty slow service, getting orders wrong and not having certain foods ready. I keep coming back because of the brand name but otherwise horrible service"
Rico,1,"Quality decreased so much used to be so great Sunday night getting my coffee and club from Gina and Alex
Hasn’t been the same"
Ed Kassem,4,Very fast. No crazy line-ups in the morning. Worth driving there to avoid waiting. No drive-thru though. You have to get out of your car.
Erin Biagini,1,"Terrible food quality and even worse customer service. I get that working in food service and customer service in general is not great, but that is no excuse to treat your customers like absolute garbage. Will not be returning after my experience this afternoon."
Mike Lowery,3,"As with all Tim Horton's they no longer make the doughnuts instore, and the lack of quality shows. Coffee, since they changed suplliers years ago, has also suffered. Okay for once in a while, but really, we need better doughnut and coffee shops. The store itself, is clean, and service is what you'd expect; it's good enough."
Jeremy Atkinson,1,I've been here twice now and a few of their people were not wearing masks.  In perticular the guy restocking the donuts fresh from the oven couldn't be bothered to cover his nose or his mouth while he hovered over the freshly baked donuts.  Anyone up for a COVID 19 donut?  They ice it in the shape of a crown
Ibrahem elsabawi,2,"The bagels were not fresh at all, they were rock solid! I felt like I was eating Dwayne Johnson himself. The staff were very friendly though."
Jupiter Kyle,3,Extremely frustrating to try and go here before 5am. The site says 24/7 but the door is locked overnight. The ladies working at 5am are lovely though. Still frustrating. Update your hours
Barry Robinson,1,"Service used to be good,  now they are just down right rude. They rush your order,  don't give you time to collect rewards or use offers. If they keep this up, this location will lose my business."
Opee Dhoe,1,"Needs to be managed better, some people are waiting 10 minutes for a coffee let alone any food"
Foxy Torino,2,"Bad coffee.... I feel its a gamble to eat there as it might be good or not.

I suggest the Tim Horton on Hymus and Des Sources.

Great managements and super clean and full o fresh donuts no matter the time of the day !!!"
Maxime Daviault,5,One of the best Tim Hortons in the west island! It offers efficient customer service and has no drive through so the speed at which they operate seems faster than your average tims
marian Pieklo,5,Well it's a Tim Hortons store.The coffee has always been hot every time that I have been there and their food is always fresh.After you finish eating and drinking your coffee you can go to Walmart or the Dollar Store or Home Depot.
Sheida Sn,1,"All of our orders were served cold☹ and n9t exactly what we wanted, missing cream, too much milk, etc. The cashier was not paying attention at all. He touched fork that we asked with bare hand, no glove ☹"
Selvalingam Mayooran,5,Excellent service and very quick I just order a medium double the work is there very friendly with the clients
Captain Nizar Dayoub,1,Nothing like Tim Hortons
Monique Orrell,3,"Only had a coffee, but needed to go to the bathroom. One stall had what looked to be a very dirty seat as it was brown coloured and the other, the handicapped one was out of toilet paper. I usually always rely on Tim Hortons bathroom and this one was a complete fail."
Martin Lefebvre,1,"Ordered a breakfast bundle ""
FesTim déjeuner classique pour 2 personnes"" that comes with two sandwiches, hash browns, coffees and a box of timbits. Received no hash browns and no coffees."
Allan Goodridge,2,"Oh my! Under staffed.....had to wait a good 30 to 40mins for a cup of coffee...and that was before the stores in the mall opened
Wish I could say it wasn't so....but it was."
Jean Jean,3,"It's okay.
I got my regular muffins there.
Watch out for the cashiers as they try to give you more than what you ordered so they can take more off your pockets if you're not paying attention."
Notorious Phil,5,They work so hard and have to deal with very rude impatient people but keep their cool. Great spot for a quick morning treat 😊 …
Todd Decker,2,Under staffed - much much to slow. Nice front cashier though
Joel Barman,4,"Everytime I come up to the Great White North, I always go to Tim Horton's. I know it's not like Dunkin Donuts in the states, but it's ok. With the exchange rate, it's dirt cheap for me."
Peter Rusyn,1,"This is a run down Tim Hortons in Pointe-Claire, Quebec. The owner doesn't care... Never has donuts, always smells of burnt Tim bits when you walk in and the Tim Hortons sign had letters burnt out for over 6 months. Calling out the owner... You need to give a little care, just a little."
Brian Murphy,1,Incredibly slow whenever I go here. 20 mins for a breakfast sandwich and they still managed to get it wrong.
Tom Harry,1,Very bad  sevice from morning  shift . So rude  employees so slow sevice. Store is  not clen. I will waiting my orders 13min she take  care another customer. I thing this store management  very  bad .we  are call from  head office soon.pls change management.
Lazarus Epoo,1,"Ordered from Uber eats. Asian guy calls me and doesn’t know the meaning of allergies when I told him I am allergic to raisins. Asked to speak to someone else, and they’re no better at English than the first guy. Also, didn’t speak French."
William Robert LEWIS,1,They gave my sandwich to someone who joined the line 10 minutes after me. Make sure you take your receipt.
Michal Robert,5,We  are visiting Monday evening 7p.m  sevice friendly .my coffee and sandwiches  awesome cashier woking excellent sevice. Thank  you  for my favorite hot coffee
Sam Linaa,5,Wow we  are going to this tim Hotion every night. One of the Young guy woking her every night. He  wokeing awsome.he always wash he hand make my sandwich  super.all ways clen and smile face..super service. 😍 …
Melissa Lockey-Chatham,3,"Was very dirty the last time I went. Normally, It's one if the cleaner Tim Hortons I've been to. However, they seemed short staffed in the middle of lunch."
Peter Sergakis,1,"Lots of staff walking around left and right, 5 total, 3 pick up orders and they make customers in line wait 20 minutes to get to the cash."
Noor Shadeed,1,Everytime I go to order iced coffee he gives me iced cap and after telling him that I ordered iced coffee not iced capp he just says that there's no iced coffee!!! It happened with me more than two times tho
Hal T,1,This has got to the worst Tim Horton’s in the entire country. The service is so bad and slow. It’s obvious that this establishment is understaffed.
Mangla Gogna,1,Received deliver with a wrong muffin and coffee spilled out with a open lid in bag. Uncooked wrap👎🏻
Giuseppe Bonadonna,1,"Really slow in the morning ,really slow at lunch time ,no one taking orders at the counter cause they are preparing food...."
Elizabeth Munoz,4,"It has good coffee, breakfast food and different kinds of pastries. If you like cream and sugar in your coffee, ask for a double-double."
Andrew Laramee,3,The cashier seemed rushed and got both my fiancée's and my order wrong. At least the guy who put our order together fixed it without any extra questions.
one human,2,What's the point of a phone number if nobody ever picks up? There isn't even a drive thru at your location how busy can it be 3 days in a row to not pick up the phone once. Lol
Rohan Peter,1,Very bad service   so slow  .service. people are roud face. I am waiting  my   bagal 30 min.  Horrible service morning  today.

Mark Bowditch,2,This is the slowest Tim Hortons I’ve ever been to. 15 minutes to get a coffee and donut.
ILOVECOOKIES,1,Ppl doing nasty things in the back room you could see from the side walk never eating there again that’s forsure
RACHID YASSINE,3,Mac cafe has better taste than tim sandwiches are not expert on it all processed no taste not healthy.

Traveler Patel,1,Very rude manager or maybe the owner.. I think he has to go to kindergarten to learn how to speak with people
Sunny Dabas,1,Worst Tim I ever visited. Shelves were empty. Bad experience.
Jonathan Hynes,2,Service isn't great. Employees are never in a good mood. Timbits are always delicious.

maxime gauthier,1,Great place
Dimitri Liakopoulos,4,"On February 19, I was with a friend when an unpleasant scene occurred. A woman severely reprimanded a young employee, whom my friends and I know well for his good humor and his friendliness towards customers. Her behavior towards him was excessively harsh and unprofessional, especially in front of customers. Touched by the situation, I decided to tip the young man to show my support, as he seemed both sad and embarrassed, while remaining kind to the woman. It seemed to me that the latter should have chosen a more appropriate place to reprimand him, out of sight. This scene moved me deeply, making me imagine my own son in his place. It broke my heart. Even if the young person had made mistakes, there was surely a more constructive way to make them understood to him without publicly humiliating him."
Robert Robert,1,"I always go at 7 in the morning and the staff is very friendly, fast and attentive. Everything clean and the food excellent"
Diego PL,5,"I received a chicken wrap without chicken and with uncooked bacon. Tim Horton's has become one of the worst restaurants, even their coffee has become terrible."
Stephen Rozz,1,"Service still courteous but that's all
The toilets are generally clean
Not much else to say"
Ronaldine Cadet,4,"Terrible service. I ordered a soup but the customers after me who ordered a sandwich went before... no cabaret for the service. The tables are all dirty. Nobody speaks French. Avoid very slow service. Take one order at a time, impossible to make 2 coffees."
Vinny Maxta,1,OK overall. It's a Tim Hortons without drive-thru ordering. Fresh produce in the morning but leaves something to be desired in the afternoon.
Eric Bourguet,3,The food and service were good without being fantastic but the tables were dirty and the trash can was full.
Erika Murillo,4,"This Tim doesn't speak French. The service is 0. The meals are not good at all. Commands are misunderstood and poorly executed. What you order does not arrive as requested. The staff is not professional and often laugh at the customers. This place is not recommendable at all, you are not welcome if you are French speaking."
Riette Gauthier,1,A Tim Hortons no donuts! NO DONUTS WOW. We got there
Marc Blanchette,1,"Service 0 I ordered a cheese bagel
He served me a reheated bagel, that’s all
It’s a theft of trust the servers are lousy the service at 07 am"
Amar Albane,1,"On Sunday, with a cash register and a line to the door, isn't that logical?! You lose sales when people leave! No drive-through service. And the last time I grabbed a donut after work, it was dry and not edible.... You always get the orders wrong... It seems like you don't care about losing customers.... I don't go to your house anymore. Well tired of the crappy service."
Eric Bourguet,1,"Monday May 23, 2022, Unilingual English-speaking cashier, no seasoning (mayonnaise) in the BLT sandwich as well as in the crispy chicken. Messy place, see the floors, the toilets as well as the trash can for table scraps which was overflowing. Very disappointing."
Suzy Gingras,1,"There were three of us customers waiting for our order, it really took a long time and there were 7 employees behind the counter... two at the cash registers, one for the coffee and one for the sandwiches... the others were just chatting so it was super long. I hate it when I feel like I'm bothering you. Plus when I got my sandwich it was cut in half, you had one job to do.... Ah yes! What's the problem with cabarets and their rounded bottoms? Am I the only one who doesn't find it a winner with a bottle of water?"
Marc St-jean,2,If you are looking for a good Tim the mocha made by Newran are excellent the staff and friendly professional always a pleasure Thank you
Judith p.c,5,Order 2 soups 2 coffees 2 donuts arrives at destination 1 spoon for 2 soups and no donut out of 3 employees only 1 was bilingual the other 2 were unilingual English in this case I only speak French the most funny they were talking about me without knowing that I understood English 1st and last time I go to this Tim corner St Jean and Hymus
Marie Andree Clermont,1,"The cashier was arguing with an employee who was sitting directly on the floor where the donut rack goes, cleaning the walls.  To find out who's going to put my dozen donuts in my box because neither of them had enough heart in their stomachs.   It was the one sitting on the floor who did it reluctantly without even washing her hands.  I will never go to that Tim Horton again."
vincent boisvert,1,I wanted my favorite sandwich but the bread was missing and the coffee tasted weird.
Ion Dragoescu,1,Cold and slow customer service. They get the orders wrong and if you want to be served in French go elsewhere.
